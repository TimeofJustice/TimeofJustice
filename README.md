I’m a Computer Science student and passionate developer with a strong love for Python, Vue.js, and Django.

- 📖 Currently working on my bachelor’s thesis.
- 🥕 My thesis focuses on building a web platform that suggests seasonal and regional recipes, aiming to promote sustainable eating habits by making seasonal availability more accessible and user-friendly.
- 🌱 I’m always learning and exploring new technologies, especially in web development and backend design.
- 🕹️ Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, reading, and watching movies and series.
- 🎵 Fun fact: I couldn’t imagine life without music.
